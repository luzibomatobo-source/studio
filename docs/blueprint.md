## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Dark green (#2E8B57), drawing inspiration from the logo's deeper green tones, creates a natural and grounded feel.
- Background color: Off-white (#F8F8FF), complementing the green, ensures readability and maintains a clean aesthetic.
- Accent color: A slightly lighter shade of green (#3CB371), used sparingly for the 'Buy Now' button and interactive elements, providing subtle contrast.
- Font: Utilize the font family/style from the logo for all headings and buttons. If a direct match isn't available, select a similar font known for its readability and slightly rounded edges (consider Nunito or similar Google Fonts).
- Maintain a clean, bold, and modern UI optimized for mobile responsiveness with quick load times. Prioritize clear information hierarchy and intuitive navigation.
- Use vegetable icons related to box content, employing a consistent style that complements the overall aesthetic. These icons should be simple, easily recognizable, and slightly stylized to avoid appearing overly generic.
- Implement subtle transition animations when switching to the next delivery date. These animations should be smooth and unobtrusive, enhancing the user experience without being distracting.
