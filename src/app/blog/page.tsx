            At Shepherd Header, we believe food should connect us â€“ to the land, to the people who grow it, and to each other. Thatâ€™s why weâ€™re building more than just a veggie delivery service. Weâ€™re building a movement, and you are at the heart of it.
            </p>
            <p>
            Every box we pack reflects your needs, your tastes, and your suggestions. Whether itâ€™s asking for more leafy greens, sharing your love for fresh herbs, or suggesting a new product, we listen â€“ and act. Our mission is to co-create this with you, from the ground up.
            </p>
            <p>
            This isnâ€™t a one-size-fits-all box. Itâ€™s a box shaped by community. Your feedback helps us choose what to grow with our farmers, what to include week-to-week, and even what ideas we explore next. Want fresh juice? Dried herbs? A fruit add-on? Say the word.
            </p>
            <p>
            Weâ€™re committed to working with small and medium-scale farmers around Bulawayo to bring you honest, chemical-free produce â€“ but the real magic happens when we work hand-in-hand with our customers.
            </p>
            <p>
            So keep the ideas coming! Drop us a message on our website, send us a DM, or chat to us when we deliver. Your voice matters here.
            </p>
            <p className="font-bold">Letâ€™s grow this together.</p>
            <p>
            With gratitude,
            <br />
